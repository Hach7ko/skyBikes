# skyBikes

The city wants to put in place a new bicycle rental program for all citizens; the name of the program is Sky Bikes! However before going ahead with signing the contract, the mayor has mandated you to provide a visual prototype that will simulate and explain the program, albeit on a simplified scale, to all stakeholders.

## Usage
npm install
npm start
