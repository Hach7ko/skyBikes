# Sky Bikes

_The city wants to put in place a new bicycle rental program for all citizens; the name of the program is Sky Bikes! However before going ahead with signing the contract, the mayor has mandated you to provide a visual prototype that will simulate and explain the program, albeit on a simplified scale, to all stakeholders._

## Usage
`npm install`

`npm start` _to run the project_

`npm test` _to run unit test_

`npm run test-e2e` _to run e2e test_

## Improvements

EVERYTHING.
There is a lot of things that I'm sure could havve been done another way, or better!

The main thing I would have love to be able to complete is the complete integration of the Google Maps API. At the moment it's only showing you all the stations, and once you click on it it shows you the bikes available.
I would have like to be able to add a label in the marker to show how many bikes are left for example.

I'm also disappointed that I was not able to find a way to do unit testing with js-vanilla web-components. I tried several things but none of them where working correctly, probably because of my lack of knowledge in this field.

## Last but not least
This was a very good exercice for me, even though it was tricky to be able to spend some time working on this given my agenda!
I found also difficult to try and restraint myself to not do a lot more than 8 hours, so I could give a real idea of what I'm capable (or not)
I would say that taken my history of working with Polymer-1 only, and without having done any unit or e2e test, I'm quite happy with the result. It was difficult to stop and not try to fix or improve every little things I was seeing.

If possible, I would be more than happy to spend some time and do a code review so I can learn from mistakes and have a better idea of what to do correctly - please feel free to reach out for me if anything!
